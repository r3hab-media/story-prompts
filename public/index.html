                A character is a person, animal, being, creature, or thing in a story. Writers use characters to perform the actions and speak dialogue, moving the story along a plot line. The main character may be part of the major characters of the story. There are two types of major characters:<br><br>

              Incorporating a diverse range of characters is one of the best ways to create a captivating fictional
              book. You’ve probably seen some cliche characters in every literary scenario, from the super-strong hero
              to the devoted timid servant. But does every story have these characters? Is it important to include all
              kinds of characters? What exactly is their role?<br><br>
              <h5>Character Types:</h5>
              <a href="#!" class="dialog" onclick="window.hero.show()">Hero</a>
              <dialog id="hero">
                When we say the word ‘hero’, it is the classic character that comes to our mind. The lead character is
                lauded for their dauntlessness, idealism, ethics, and achievements.

            The indifference between both the foil character and the protagonists helps highlight some of the
