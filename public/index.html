              Incorporating a diverse range of characters is one of the best ways to create a captivating fictional
              book. You’ve probably seen some cliche characters in every literary scenario, from the super-strong hero
              to the devoted timid servant. But does every story have these characters? Is it important to include all
              kinds of characters? What exactly is their role?<br><br>
              <h5>Character Types:</h5>
              <a href="#!" class="dialog" onclick="window.protagonist.show()">Protagonist</a>
              <dialog id="protagonist">
                The Protagonist, also known as an agonist, is the lead character of the story around which the whole
                plot revolves. It is a misconception that the protagonist is always the hero of the story. 90% of the
                time we observe the protagonists are good characters yet they can be virtuous or evil or neutral.

              <dialog id="hero">
                When we say the word ‘hero’, it is the classic character that comes to our mind. The lead character is
                lauded for their dauntlessness, idealism, ethics, and achievements.
                <button class="close" onclick="window.hero.close()">x</button>

                It is not the villain. Anti-hero refers to the protagonist who lacks the traditional heroic qualities of
                courage, strength, etc. They don’t have any evil intentions but do commit unethical acts.

                As mentioned earlier, the protagonist can be evil. So they are villains, and more or less the story
                revolves around them. You can consider it as the plot from the point of view of the villain.

                The antagonist is anti-agonist or anti-protagonist. The antagonist is the opposing force for the
                protagonist. It causes obstacles and creates challenges that keep the plot moving.
                <br><br>
                Just like the protagonist, the antagonist can be evil or good, although it is observed that antagonists

                In easy terms, they are the sidekicks of the protagonist. You can consider them as the secondary
                protagonists as they are seen just as close to the protagonists, and are usually their companions.
                <br><br>
                Although they are ‘secondary’, they are just as important as the protagonists.
